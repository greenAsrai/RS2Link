abstract="We study the controlled reversibility in reaction systems, a bio-inspired formalism in which the reactions take place only if some inhibitors are not present. Forward reactions are exactly those of the reaction systems, while reverse reactions happen when a special symbol indicates a change in the environment. The reversible reaction systems are translated into rewriting systems which are executable on the Maude software platform. Given such an implementation, several properties of the reversible reaction systems could be verified.",
