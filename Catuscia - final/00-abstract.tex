%Natural computing is an emerging area of research for modeling biological

In the area of Natural Computing, reaction systems are
a qualitative abstraction inspired by the 
functioning of living cells, suitable to model the main
mechanisms of biochemical reactions.
This model has already been applied
and extended successfully to various areas of research. Reaction 
systems interact with the environment represented by the context, and
pose problems of implementation, as it is a new computation model. 
In this paper we consider the {\tt link}-calculus, which allows to model 
multiparty interaction in concurrent systems, and show that it allows to
embed reaction systems, by representing the behaviour of each entity and
preserving faithfully their features. 
We show the correctness and completeness 
of our embedding.
We illustrate our framework by showing how to embed a \emph{lac} operon 
regulatory network. 
Finally, our framework can contribute to increase the expressiveness
of reaction systems, by exploiting the interaction among 
different reaction systems.
